Artificial intelligence can consume a lot of energy, so special attention was paid to reduce the carbon footprint of the analyses: no cloud platform was used - performed on a simple laptop, the computing is done asynchronously to avoid multiplying requests and live calculations.

## Carbon Footprint measurement
Moreover, the carbon footprint was measured with the [CodeCarbon tool](https://codecarbon.io/) developed by the MILA University and the Data For Good NGO, results to be released soon.
