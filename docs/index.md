## Description

I had the chance to attend the 2 weeks of the COP26 as a volunteer with the [Climate Fresk](https://climatefresk.org/) NGO to educate in the street as well as in the blue zone about climate issues. Between the grandiloquent announcements of countries and companies and the suffering shouted in the climate marches, it is difficult to understand the extent of the reactions to these 2 weeks of conferences in Glasgow. 

Many medias covered the failure of the COP and the negotiations, but it is still difficult to **quantify how people reacted, what their emotions were, which topics really marked them** - the greenwashing attempts of the companies or the [moving speeches of Vanessa Nakate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuuOts3jL3I) and other activists. 

During the 20 days covering the conference **I collected the 750,000 tweets featuring the hashtag #COP26 in order to analyze the epidermal reaction of people to the COP events**. This "COP26 radar" is the quantified analysis of the emotions behind the conference by a Data Scientist committed to fighting climate change. 

## Methodology
- Collection of 750,000 tweets featuring the hashtag COP26
- Various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
    - Emotions and irony classification with CardiffNLP pre-trained models on Hugging Face transformers hub
    - Topic classification with BERTopic

!!! warning "Important"
    - If you wonder about the environmnental balance of the analysis, there is a [section about it](/cop26radar/carbon-footprint)
    - The code will soon be open sourced
