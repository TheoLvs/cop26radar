Between the grandiloquent announcements of countries and companies and the suffering shouted in the climate marches, it is difficult to understand the extent of the reactions to these 2 weeks of conferences in Glasgow. Many medias covered the failure of the COP and the negotiations, but it is still difficult to quantify how people reacted, what their emotions were, which topics really marked them - the greenwashing attempts of the companies or the moving speeches of Vanessa Nakate and other activists. During the 20 days covering the conference I collected the 750,000 tweets featuring the hashtag #COP26 in order to analyze the epidermal reaction of people to the COP events . This \"COP26 radar\" is the quantified analysis of the emotions behind the conference by a Data Scientist committed to fighting climate change. Methodology \u00b6 Collection of 750,000 tweets featuring the hashtag COP26 Various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques Emotions and irony classification with CardiffNLP pre-trained models on Hugging Face transformers hub Topic classification with BERTopic Important If you wonder about the environmnental balance of the analysis, there is a section about it The code will soon be open sourced About the author \u00b6 My name is Theo Alves Da Costa , I am Head of AI for Sustainability at Ekimetrics where I create and develop Data & Artificial Intelligence solutions for businesses to operate within the planetary boundaries .
